# Computer-Organization-and-Assembly-Language-Lecture
In this repo I added what I did in the lecture of Computer Organization and Assembly Language, some of the tasks got ful mark some of them have missing parts.

In my assembly language course, I gained extensive programming knowledge using MASM32 and Visual Studio. The curriculum covered assembly basics, numeral systems, and binary representation. I developed proficiency in CPU registers, memory addressing, and general-purpose instructions, focusing on arithmetic calculations. Through practical examples and assignments, I refined skills in calculations, text processing, and arrays. The course explored advanced topics like inline assembly in C/C++, boolean operators, conditions, and keyboard interrupt processing. I also learned about assembly procedures, parameter passing, modular compilation, and interfacing with high-level languages. The hands-on approach and assessments provided a strong foundation in low-level programming, preparing me for tasks involving video output, interrupts, and timers. This coursework enhanced my ability to code efficiently in assembly and apply these skills to solve complex problems.
